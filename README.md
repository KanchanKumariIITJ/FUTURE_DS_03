# College Event Feedback Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing student feedback collected after various college events such as Tech Fests, Cultural Events, Workshops, Seminars, and other academic activities. The main purpose of the project is to evaluate student satisfaction, understand feedback sentiment, and generate actionable insights to improve future event planning and execution.

The analysis combines numerical ratings with textual feedback using data analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This approach helps transform raw feedback data into meaningful information that supports data-driven decision-making.

## Project Overview

College events play an important role in enhancing student engagement, learning experience, and overall campus life. Although feedback is commonly collected after events, it is often not analyzed in a structured manner. As a result, valuable insights related to student satisfaction and expectations are missed.

This project addresses that gap by systematically analyzing student feedback data to identify strengths, weaknesses, and improvement opportunities across different types of college events.

## Business & Problem Statement

Educational institutions invest significant time and resources in organizing events. However, without proper analysis of student feedback, it becomes difficult to measure event effectiveness, identify problem areas, and improve future events.

**Problem Statement:**  
How can student feedback data be analyzed effectively to measure satisfaction levels, understand sentiment, and support data-driven decisions for improving college events?

---

## Objective & Outcomes

The objective of this project is to analyze student feedback data to assess overall satisfaction and sentiment related to college events. The outcome of the analysis is a set of clear insights that highlight high-performing events, identify areas requiring improvement, and provide recommendations to enhance student engagement and event quality.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of student feedback collected through online forms after college events. It includes:
- Event-related information  
- Satisfaction ratings on a scale of 1 to 5  
- Open-ended textual feedback from students  

The dataset was cleaned and prepared before analysis to ensure consistency and reliability.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib / Recharts** – Data visualization  
- **TextBlob** – Sentiment analysis using NLP  
- **Google Colab / VS Code** – Development and execution environment

## Analysis Performed

The analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Rating analysis was used to study overall satisfaction trends, average ratings by event type, and variations across different categories. Sentiment analysis was applied to textual feedback to classify responses into Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiments, providing deeper insights into student opinions.

---

## Sentiment Analysis Summary

Most of the student feedback reflects positive sentiment, indicating a generally good experience across events. Neutral sentiment suggests average satisfaction with scope for improvement, while negative sentiment highlights issues related to logistics, organization, and scheduling. Sentiment analysis helps explain the reasons behind numerical ratings.

---

## Key Insights

The analysis reveals that interactive events such as workshops and technical events receive higher satisfaction ratings. Positive sentiment is strongly associated with content quality and speaker effectiveness, while negative sentiment is mainly linked to organizational and management issues.

---

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, the project recommends improving event planning and scheduling, enhancing interaction during seminars and workshops, focusing on content quality, and conducting regular feedback analysis to track improvements over time.

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics and NLP techniques can be used to transform raw student feedback into actionable insights. By combining ratings with sentiment analysis, institutions can make informed decisions that improve event quality and overall student satisfaction.
